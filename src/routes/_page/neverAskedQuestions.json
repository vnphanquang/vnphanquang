    "answer": [
      "The crux of the climate change argument is not the fact that it is changing but the rate at which it is. CO2 is just the tip of the iceburg with no clear indication for ordinary folks. Ocean acidification is the evil twin of global warming. Species are going extinct at a rate much greater than the background extinction rate.",
      "This rate of change is comparable to previous mass extinctions in earth history. If that doesn't make you 💩 your pants, then hold your bladder and read Elizabeth Kolbert's \"The Sixth Extinction\"."
